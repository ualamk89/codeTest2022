Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc

**What Makes It Good:**

Dependency Injections:
The use of dependency injections in the constructor is a best practice, promoting clean and testable code.

Meaningful Names:
Methods and variables have meaningful names, contributing to enhanced code readability.

Comments:
Some comments explaining the purpose of methods are present, which is helpful for newcomers to the codebase.

Logging:
Logging is implemented, capturing relevant information for debugging and monitoring.

Code Separation:
There is an effort towards code separation, possibly to enhance modularity.

**Areas for Improvement:**

Exception Handling:
Implement proper exception handling to ensure graceful handling of errors.

Logging Improvement:
Utilize Laravel's built-in logging mechanisms instead of hard-coded paths for better configurability.

Code Redundancy in Store Function:
The store function in BookingRepository has multiple if-else conditions; consider creating separate functions for better code organization.

Missing Parentheses:
While it's a matter of style, consider using parentheses for better clarity, especially when conditions become more complex.

Separate Email Function:
Consider creating a dedicated function for sending emails to enhance code modularity.

Eloquent for ID Checks:
Utilize Eloquent's simplicity for ID checks, such as using Model::find($id) instead of Model::where('id', '=', $id).

One-Line Conditions:
Use one-line conditions where applicable for concise and readable code.

Remove Redundant Return:
Remove the redundant return false statement just below the return true in the changeTimedoutStatus function.

Handling User Not Found:
Address the missing code for handling cases where a user is not found in the controller.

Code Refactoring for Complexity:
Break down complex conditions in functions, improving both readability and maintainability.

Code Readability and Formatting:
Ensure consistent code formatting and consider adding comments where needed for complex logic.

Y. Refactoring Suggestions:
Addressing the above points will result in a more robust, maintainable, and readable codebase. The suggested refactoring steps include:

1. Introduce comprehensive exception handling.
2. Refine the logging approach.
3. Modularize the store function in BookingRepository.
4. Enhance code readability through parentheses usage.
5. Create a separate function for email sending.
6. Utilize Eloquent's simplicity for ID checks.
7. Optimize conditions with one-line statements.
8. Remove redundant return statements.
9. Implement handling for cases where a user is not found.
10.These improvements will contribute to a more polished and maintainable codebase, aligning with best practices and enhancing overall code quality.

IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes.

NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!
